# Don-t-Stop-Movin-
All you have to do is to download the zip and run the .exe file. That should work and open up a window with the game showing a truck and the text "don't stop movin'" and "press space...". If you want to run this in an IDE, it is important they are all in one folder and move it into the location of the project so pygame can recognise the files. You can view each individual piece of source code by opening each python file. There should be 5 in total, and you should run General.py as the main file. All jumps are possible, though some are just very hard. Jump Buffering and Coyote Time are my next goals.
Thanks :)
