# Don-t-Stop-Movin-
All you have to do is to download the zip and run the .exe file. That should work and open up a window with the game. When you fail off the stage, an error message will show up but that is normal. I have just forced exit the game, so if you just open the executable again, it will run again.
Thanks :)
